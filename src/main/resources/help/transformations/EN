<h1>Transformations</h1>
</center>

Transformations are the main purpose of this application - they allow you to rotate, stretch, translate
(move sideways or up and down), and crop the pages, individually or many at a time, to change a clumsily scanned
PDF into a document suitable for printing and/or binding.
<br>
<br>
The transformations tab allows you to edit the current <em>transformation set</em>, which is selectable by the
drop-down menu at the top of the tabbed pane.  It also allows you to add new transformation sets (+ button),
delete existing ones (X button), and move the currently selected transformation set up and down in the list
(up arrow and down arrow buttons).
<br>
<br>
Each transformation set is given a comma-separated list of applicable page ranges, which can overlap.  Unlike with
source document page ranges, a transformation set page range may use references to specific source documents,
for example:
<br>
<br>
"doc1:101-199 odd, 12-20 even, 50-60"
<br>
<br>
This means the associated transformation set applies to:<br>
 <ul>
 <li>odd-numbered pages between 101 and 199 from the source document with id "doc1"
 <li>even pages from the target document between pages 12 and 20
 <li>all target pages between 50 and 60
 </ul>
<br>
<br>
The order of the transformation sets in the list (in the drop-down menu) matters, since it dictates the order in which
the transformation sets are applied, and results in a list of applicable transformation sets for each page in the
target document.  Consider the following example, where three distinct transformation sets are in the drop-down
list, in a specific order:
<br>
<br>
<center>
<img src="/images/page_transforms.png">
</center>
<br>
<br>
As the target document is generated, the application determines which transformation sets apply to each output page,
before generating it.  In the above figure, for example, all three transformations apply to page 26, but only the first
transformation set applies to page 35.
<br>
<br>
Similarly, each transformation set comprises a (re-orderable, variable-length) list of <em>transformations</em>,
also selectable from a drop-down menu (always at the bottom of the list, as it grows).  Each transformation with
an associated range has a numeric range field, the value of which can be entered using the leftmost text entry
(value), or by moving the slider.  On either side of the transformation's slider, the endpoints of the slider
range can be set.  Note, if either end of the slider range is changed such that the current value falls out of
the new range, then the current value will be set to the nearest end of the new range.
<br>
<br>
The available transformations include:
 <ul>
 <li>ROTATION</li>rotates the image (around the centre of the page), counterclockwise, by the given number of degrees.
 <li>SCALE</li> scales both width (X) and height (Y) of the page by the given factor.  1.0 is unchanged.
 <li>HORIZONTAL SCALE</li>scales only the page width
 <li>VERTICAL SCALE</li>scales only the page height
 <li>LEFT CROP</li>crops the left edge of the page off by the given ratio of the page width.
 <li>RIGHT CROP</li>crops the right edge of the page off by the given ratio of the page width.
 <li>BOTTOM CROP</li>crops the bottom edge of the page off by the given ratio of the page width.
 <li>TOP CROP</li>crops the top edge of the page off by the given ratio of the page width.
 <li>CROP ALL SIDES</li>crops all sides of the page off by the given ratio of the page width (left and right
 sides) and page height (bottom and top sides).
 <li>CROP TO MARGINS</li>crops the page content to the currently defined margins.
 <li>HORIZONTAL TRANSLATION</li>moves the page image left or right by the given ratio of the page width.
 <li>VERTICAL TRANSLATION</li>moves the page image down or up by the given ratio of the page width.
 </ul>
<br>
<br>
As with entire transformation sets, the order of the list of transforms matters.  Rotating before cropping a page,
for example, will result in a crop region on the bottom of the page; cropping before rotating will result in a
rotated cropped region.

<h2>Example Transformation Set for One Page</h2>
<br>
<br>
In the following example, let's say we have a single source document, an old text on
applied physics, to which (in the sources tab) we give the document identifier "ap".
Let's say we are taking only pages 100-150 from the text to include in our target document.
<br>
<br>
After generating our target document with margins and page numbers, we notice that with page 140 of the applied
physics text (page 41 of our target document), the content is 1) rotated counter-clockwise by several degrees 2) shrunk
3) shifted upwards and 4) shifted to the right, as such:
<br>
<center>
<img src="/images/page_pre_transform.png">
</center>
<br>
<br>
To remedy this, we then create a single transform set that applies only to this one page.  We first add a rotation
of -4.8 degrees (4.8 degrees clockwise), then a scale factor of 1.29.  We then add horizontal translation of
12% left (-0.12) and a vertical translation of 3.4% down (-0.034):

<br>
After clicking on GENERATE, we can see that the page is transformed to the following form:
