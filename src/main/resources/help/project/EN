<h1>Project Structure</h1>
</center>
<br>
<br>
The Project tab is where the main aspects of a book project are configured.  The tab content looks like this:

<br>
<br>
The controls on this tab are as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>Name</b></li> This is a unique project name and has no significance in the printing of the output.
<b>NOTE: Text fields in SOB are not "set" until you hit enter.  As a visual aid, when an (unset) change is made
to a text field, the background is coloured cyan; hitting enter will set the value and the background will revert to
white.  Setting a value does not permanently save it.  To do that, you must save the entire project using File->Save
or File->SaveAs.</b>
<li><b>Output Path</b></li>
  The PDF file that is generated when clicking on the GENERATE button, using defined
  <a href="sources">source files</a> and <a href="transformations">transformations</a>
<li><b>Signatures Output Directory</b></li>
  Signatures are sections of folded sheets.  Each section is printed to a separate file; this text field (with
  a directory chooser) allows you to set the destination directory for signature PDF generation (i.e., when
  the GENERATE SIGNATURES button is clicked).
<li><b>Initial Scale</b></li>
  If checked, each chosen page of the source document(s) will be initially, individually pre-scaled to a largest
  contained size within the configured output page size.  Depending on the relative aspect ratios of the source and
  target pages, this may result in a maximum width or a maximum height.
<li><b>Margins (Checkbox)</b></li>
  If checked, a margin overlay will be drawn over each page.  This is useful for adjusting content using
  <a href="transformations">transformations</a>, such that it is consistent throughout the document.  Note: the
  margin line width, colour, horizontal rule count and vertical rule count can all be set in the
  options dialog.
<li><b>Page Numbers</b></li>
  If checked, a page number overlay will be drawn over each page, allowing you to easily reference either a specific
  source document page, or a final page, for use in page range specification in a
  <a href="transformations">transformation</a>.
<li><b>Page/Signature Size</b></li>
  This drop-down menu allows you to select a predefined document page size and signature page size.  In general,
  the signature page size is twice that of the document page size, but in practice, printing applications, for example
  the standard print dialog on a Mac, can easily scale a page to the paper size.  What really matters is that the
  page size and signature page size have the same aspect ratio, and that the aspect ratio matches that of the
  paper you intend to print on (if you are printing).
<li><b>Margins (Left/Right/Bottom/Top)</b></li>
  These four fields allow you to set the width of each of the four (overlay) margins, specified as a ratio of the page
  width (left and right margins) or page height (bottom and top margins).  A left margin of 0.07, for example, will
  create a margin on the left that is 7% the width of the page.
<li><b>(Signatures) Sheets</b></li>
  This is the number of physical (double sized) sheets of paper in a folded signature.  Each sheet has four pages of
  the source document printed on it, so an 8-sheet signature, for example, will contain 32 pages of output document.
<li><b>(Signatures) Minimise Last</b></li>
  If checked, the last signature will be minimised such that the number of sheets with printed matter are as few as
  possible.  Note, SOB will never print the empty sheets that pad out the last signature to the configured number of
  sheets per signature, since they are blank.
<li><b>(Signatures) Spine Offset</b></li>
  This is the offset (as a ratio of page width) of each output document page from the spine (i.e. the fold),
  when printed in a signature, on either the left side of an odd page or on the right side of an even page.
  A non-zero value will cause the page to be scaled (with retention of aspect ratio) to accommodate the offset.
<li><b>(Signatures) Edge Offset</b></li>
  Similar to the Sping Offset, this is the offset (as a ratio of page width) of each output document page from
  the edge (i.e. the open edge of the book, or the far left and far right margins of a signature page in
  landscape), when printed in a signature.  A non-zero value will cause the page to be scaled (with retention of
  aspect ratio) to accommodate the offset.
<li><b>Comments</b></li>
  This field allows you to note comments about the book project, any outstanding changes, results, etc.
