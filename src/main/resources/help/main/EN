<h2>Introduction</h2>
<em>Son of Binderator</em>, or <em>SOB</em> is a simple dialog application for the manipulation of PDF documents,
scanned or generated.  It is primarily intended for use in the hobby of bookbinding, but can also be used to simply
clean up a messy PDF to a format that is aesthetically pleasing and consistent.
<br>
<br>
SOB does not display the documents that it operates on by itself; rather, it is expected that a high quality PDF reader
such as Adobe's Acrobat Reader, Apple's Preview, or Linux's Evince, be used to view the output of SOB, typically running
next to it on the same display.
<br>
<br>
SOB has two possible output functions, document generation, and signature generation, the latter referring to the
generation of folded book sections (signatures) that are stitched together on a frame and then bound in
(typically hardback) covers.  If you wish to simply beautify a scanned PDF, for example, to make all the pages
uniformly justified on all sides, crop off a few edges, adjust the scale on select pages etc, then simple document
generation will suffice.
<br>
<br>
These instructions are broken into three sections, loosely corresponding to the three main tabs of the application,
plus some suggestions around workflow:
<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><a href="project">Project Configuration</a></li> - General settings for an entire book project.
<li><a href="sources">Source Files</a></li> - How to select an ordered list of source files and pages from them.
<li><a href="transformations">Transformations</a></li> - How to transform the pages of a document.
<li><a href="workflow">Workflow</a></li> - Suggestions for general use, both for document and signature generation.
<ol>
