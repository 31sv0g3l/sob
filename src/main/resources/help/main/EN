<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<em>Son of Binderator</em> (SOB) is a tool for the manipulation of PDF documents, primarily for the purposes
of bookbinding.
<br>
<br>
SOB has two possible output functions, document generation and signature generation.  Document generation can
be used to simply clean up a PDF with messy geometry to a format that is aesthetically pleasing and
consistent across all its pages, using cropping, rotation, horizontal and vertical translation, and the like.
Signature generation refers to the creation of individual PDFs, each of which is a folded book section (signature),
to be printed on both sides of a double-sized sheet of paper.  Signatures are stitched together on a sewing frame
and bound, typically in hardcover (library / "case" binding) format.
<br>
<br>
SOB can display the current document that it operates on using an inline PDF viewer (ICEPDF); however,
a high quality PDF reader such as Adobe's Acrobat Reader, Apple's Preview, or Linux's Evince, can be
still used to view the output before printing.
<br>
<br>
These instructions are broken into three sections, loosely corresponding to the three main tabs of the application,
plus some suggestions around workflow:
<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><a href="project">Project Configuration</a></li> - General settings for an entire book project.
<li><a href="sources">Source Files</a></li> - How to select an ordered list of source files and pages from them.
<li><a href="transformations">Transformations</a></li> - How to transform the pages of a document.
<li><a href="text_generation">Text Generators</a></li> - Add text such as headings and page numbers to a book.
<li><a href="workflow">Workflow</a></li> - Suggestions for general use, both for document and signature generation.
<ol>
