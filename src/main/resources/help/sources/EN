<h1>Source Files</h1>
</center>

<br>
<br>
The Sources tab is where the source PDF documents of a project are defined.  You can specify an arbitrary number
of source files, but they must all be PDF format and be well-formed PDF documents that can be read by applications
such as Acrobat or Apple Preview.  The sources tab looks like this:

<br>
At the top of the tab, a combo menu allows you to choose the current source document to configure:
<br>

</center>
As shown above, to the right of the combo menu are four buttons:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>New (+)</b></li> This will create a new source document, initially with the name "NEW"
<li><b>Up (&#8593);</b></li> This will move the currently displayed source document "up" (earlier) in the list.
That is, when the target document is generated, the current document will be included earlier.  The current document
will remain displayed in the sources tab.
<li><b>Down (&#8595;)</b></li> This will move the currently displayed source document "down" (later) in the list.
When the target document is generated, the current document will be included later.  The current document will
remain displayed in the sources tab.
<li><b>Delete (X)</b></li> This will delete the currently displayed source document from the list, if any, and the
source document will not be included in the output.  Note: The associated source document will not be modified in
any way.
</ul>
<br>
<br>
The other fields on the page, relevant to the currently selected source document are as follows:
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Name</b></li> This is a name for your own reference, describing the document, and can be empty.
<li><b>Id</b></li> This is a <em>simple</em> identifier for the document, that allows you to refer to it in
the page ranges of <a href="transformation">transformations</a>.  In general, 1-3 characters are all that is needed,
for example "d1" to denote document 1, or "bt" to denote "biology text".
<li><b>Path</b></li> This is the path to the actual PDF source document.  It can be edited by hand, or you can use
the file chooser launched from the button to the right of the text entry.  This field is of mandatory.
<li><b>Page Ranges</b></li>
This is where the pages to be read from the source document are specified.  If left blank, all pages are assumed.
The format is a comma-separated list, with pages starting at 1 and ending at the number of pages in the source
document.  A range is specified with a dash between two numbers, such as 45-67.  Optionally, the word "even" or "odd"
can be added after each range (before any comma) to indicate that only the even or odd pages should be read from the
range.  Ranges can overlap.  Repetitions may also be specified using an asterisk and a multiplier after a range,
for example, 12-15 * 6, meaning pages 12 to 15 repeated 6 times, i.e. 24 pages in total.
<li><b>Blank Pages</b></li>
This specifies the location and count of any number of inserted blank pages, as a comma separated list of
page-number:count pairs.  (Count) blank pages are inserted after the specified page number.  Blank pages can be
inserted at the beginning of the document by using a page number of zero, for example: 0:5 inserts five blank pages
at the beginning.
<li><b>Comments</b></li>
This is a place to leave comments specific to the current source document only.
</ul>
