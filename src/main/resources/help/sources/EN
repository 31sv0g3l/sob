<h1>Source Files</h1>
</center>

<br>
<br>
The Sources tab is where the source PDF documents of a project are defined.  You can specify an arbitrary number
of source files, but they must all be PDF format and be well-formed PDF documents that can be read by applications
such as Acrobat or Apple Preview.  The sources tab looks like this:
<br>

<br>
At the top of the tab, a combo menu allows you to choose the current source document to configure:

</center>
As shown above, to the right of the combo menu are four buttons:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>New (+)</b></li> This will create a new source document, initially with the name "NEW"
<li><b>Up (&#8593);</b></li> This moves the currently displayed source document "up" (earlier) in the list
and is only intended for organisational purposes in the event that a large number of source documents are used.
It will not affect the position of associated content in the output document; this is controlled using the
Project Page Ranges field described below.
<li><b>Down (&#8595;)</b></li> This moves the currently displayed source document "down" (later) in the list
and is only intended for organisational purposes in the event that a large number of source documents are used.
It will not affect the position of associated content in the output document; this is controlled using the
Project Page Ranges field described below.
<li><b>Delete (X)</b></li> This will delete the currently displayed source document from the list, if any, and the
source document will not be included in the output.  If the document is referenced by id in the Project Page Ranges
field, then the Project Page Ranges field will have an error / red background and require correction.
Note: Clicking on this field will not affect the associated source document in any way.
</ul>
<br>
<br>
The other fields on the page, relevant to the currently selected source document are as follows:
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Name</b></li> This is a name for your own reference, describing the document, and can be empty.
<li><b>Id</b></li> This is a <em>simple</em> identifier for the document, that allows you to refer to it in
the Project Page Ranges field, and in the Page Ranges field on the <a href="transformation">Transforms tab</a>.
In general, 1-3 characters are all that is needed,
for example "d1" to denote document 1, or "bt" to denote "biology text".
<li><b>Path</b></li> This is the path to the actual PDF source document.  It can be edited by hand, or you can use
the file chooser launched from the button to the right of the text entry.  This field is of mandatory if the source
document is to be used to generate output.
<li><b>Comments</b></li>
This is a place to leave comments specific to the current source document only.
<li><b>Project Page Ranges</b></li>
This field is not specific to an individual source document; rather, it is where the page ragnes to be read from
all the configured source documents are specified, defining the total project output.  <b>If left blank, the output
document will be empty</b>.

The format is a comma-separated list of page ranges, where only whitespace or no space between commas denotes a
blank page.  Page ranges are specified using a document id prefix and a colon, followed by either a page number
such as "45" or a page range such as "23-74".  Ranges can overlap, and repetitions may also be specified using an
asterisk and a multiplier count after a range, for example, "12-15 * 6", meaning pages 12 through 15 repeated 6 times,
i.e. 24 pages in total.  An optional "odd" or "even" specifier can follow a page range (after any repetiion), to
denote that only odd or even pages within the range are to be included, respectively.
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
,,p:1-4,,d1:1-45 even,,,d2:1-500,d1:78-79*30,,,,,<br><br>
* Two initial blank pages<br>
* Pages 1-4 of document "p"<br>
* A blank page<br>
* Even pages from page 1 to page 45 of document "d1"<br>
* Two blank pages<br>
* The first 500 pages of document "d2"<br>
* Pages 78 and 79 of document "d1", repeated 30 times<br>
* Five trailing blank pages<br>
<br>
Changes to the Project Page Ranges field are not applied until the button to the right of the field is clicked.
When an outstanding change can be applied, the button will appear cyan in colour.<br>
<br>
When an error exists in the specified page ranges, the background of the field will appear light red and a
relevant error message will appear in the status area at the bottom of the window.<br>
</ul>
