<h1>Workflow Suggestions</h1>
</center>
<br>
Whether generating a normal document or signatures, it is generally a good idea to run SOB and your PDF viewer next
to each other on the screen, as such:
<br>

<br>
When a transformation is changed, to see the next iteration of a document, you must click on GENERATE, and possibly
on the PDF view as well.  The Evince viewer in Linux is an exception to this rule - it detects file changes and
automatically reloads / re-displays the document.  Apple Preview requires clicking once on the document to trigger
a refresh.  Depending on the operating system, Adobe Acrobat Reader may require a manual file reload.  Don't quote
me on this - these behaviours may or may not be configurable depending on the viewer.
<br>
<br>
When generating signatures, it is vital to ensure that all the pages of the main document (i.e. as produced with
the GENERATE button) are centered uniformly using the same set of margins.  This way, when a spine and/or edge offset
is introduced, or when a source page in inserted and odd pages become even and vice versa, you don't have to
worry whether pages on the left of the spine will be offset differently from those on the right.  You can simply
adjust both offsets at your leisure and know that the outcome will be symmetric.
<br>
<br>
As such, it is always best when producing signatures to:<br>
<ol>
<li> Set up the source documents and pages.
<li> Add margins and page numbers.
<li> Add all transformations necessary, to conform all source pages from all source documents to the margins
you have configured, generating and reloading the document in the viewer as required.
<li> Optionally Toggle off the margins and page numbers (before signature generation).
<li> Set a spine offset (0.05 is often a good start) and an edge offset (0 is good to start with), and
click on Generate Signatures.
<li> View the generated signatures, perhaps print one out on A3 sized paper, fold it and judge the suitability
of the spine and edge offsets on real paper.
<li> Iterate as needed.
</li>
<h1>Bookbinding</h1>
This is a vast topic, and there are many great places to find resources.  As always, a good start is YouTube, with
videos by DAS (probably the best) and others providing great tutorials.  You will need a substantial array of tools,
many of which you can craft yourself or collect from yard sales and hardware stores, but it is best to watch a few
videos to see what is required.  The best books I have found so far on the topic are "Bookbinding",
by Arthur W. Johnson (out of print, but in PDF form at openlibrary.org) and "Hand Bookbinding", by Aldren A. Watson.
<br>
<br>
I hope this app is useful and welcome any suggestions for improvements, especially bug fixes.  I'm sure there are
other similar apps out there, but I couldn't find one the way I wanted it so I cooked this one up as is and have
used it to produce the content for many personal bookbinding projects.
