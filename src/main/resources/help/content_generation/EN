<h1>Content Generators</h1>
</center>

Content generators allow the addition of regular text blocks or images on a series of pages, with or without frames.
These can be applied to an entire project or to arbitrary page ranges in a project.  For example, when combining
multiple source document books into a single volume, it may be desirable to label the pages of each source book
differently, with a book title and a page number specific to the source book.
<br>
<br>
A horizontal and vertical offset are required, which designate the origin of the text on each of the affected
pages.  The horizontal value is a ratio of page width, offset from the left, so 0.01 is near the left edge
and 0.95 is near the right edge.  The vertical offset is similarly given as a ratio of page height and is offset
from the bottom of the page; 0.01 is near the bottom of the page and 0.97 is near the top.
<br>
<br>
A text alignment drop-down allows the text to be 1) centered on the given point, 2) left justified against the given
point or 3) right-justified against the given point.  If right-justified, for example, the text grows to the left
of the given point.
<br>
<br>
The font, font size and line height (as a ratio of relaxed line height) must all be chosen, and an additional line
offset can be used to specify the vertical offset of the text as a ratio of line height, in values ranging from -10 to 10.
<br>
<br>
Page numbers can be included in the content of the text, using the designator ##.  By default, this refers to the
total (global) page number, and can have an offset, with the format +/- n.  For example, #-7# inserts the total page
number minus 7, and #+200# inserts the global page number plus 200.
<br>
<br>
Page numbers of a specific source document can be inserted by using the document id as a prefix, with a possible
offset.  For example, #doc1# inserts the page number in source document with id "doc1", and #doc1+2# inserts the
page number from source document with id "doc2", but with an offset of 2.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Frames</h3>
If the checkbox for using frames is selected, a rectangular frame will be placed, <em>centered</em> on the chosen
horizontal/vertical offset point, i.e. likely surrounding any specified text.  An optional border colour and width
in points can be specified.
<br>
<br>
Frame dimensions are specified using two values: a width, given as a ration of page width, and an X/Y (aspect)
ratio.
<br>
<br>
The background of the frame can be omitted, given as a selected (solid, opaque) colour, or as an image specified by
a chosen image path.  Images will be stretched to the borders of the surrounding frame (in both directions), so it
is prudent to specify an aspect ratio that matches that of an image, or vice versa.
<br>
<br>
Note, a simple borderless frame with a white background and no text can be used as a form of multi-page eraser.  This
may be useful for removing existing, repeated content, such as an existing page numbering in an undesirable location.

The above image shows an example of a content generator for a book with id "book2" inside a volume of books.
The even numbered pages of book2 are labeled at the center of the page, with the page number in a dark grey,
offset by -2 and superimposed on a pre-generated image.  A similar text generator for the odd numbered pages of
book2 would then be added.
