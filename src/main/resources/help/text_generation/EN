<h1>Text Generators</h1>
</center>

Text generators allow the additon of regular text blocks on a series of pages.  These can be applied to an entire
project, or to arbitrary page ranges in a project.  For example, when combining multiple source document books into
a single volume, it may be desirable to label the pages of each source book differently, with a title and a page
number specific to the source book.
<br>
<br>
A horizontal and vertical offset are required, which designate the origin of the text on each of the affected
pages.  The horizontal value is a ratio of page width, offset from the left, so 0.01 is near the left edge
and 0.95 is near the right edge.  The vertical offset is similarly given as a ratio of page height and is offset
from the bottom of the page; 0.01 is near the bottom of the page and 0.97 is near the top.
<br>
<br>
A text alignment drop-down allows the text to be 1) centered on the given point, 2) left justified against the given
point or 3) right-justified against the given point.  If right-justitifed, for example, the text grows to the left
of the given point.
<br>
<br>
Page numbers can be included in the content of the text block, using the designator ##.  By default, this refers to the
total (global) page number, and can have an offset, with the format +/- n.  For example, #-7# inserts the total page
number minus 7, and #+200# inserts the global page number plus 200.
<br>
<br>
Page numbers of a specific source document can be inserted by using the document id as a prefix, with a possible
offset.  For example, #doc1# inserts the page number in source document "doc1", and #doc1+2# inserts the doc2 page
number with an offset of 2.

The above image shows an example with a book (5) inside a volume of books.  The odd numbered pages of
"book 5" are labled at the bottom right of the page.  A similar text generator for the even numbered pages of
"book 5" would then be generated using left generated text at the bottom left of the page and the same page
number text.
