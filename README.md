# Son of Binderator

![Model](src/main/resources/help/images/binderator_preview.png)

Son of Binderator (SOB) is a java-based tool to clean up PDFs (scanned or generated)
into a form suitable for printing, either as a simple document or in binding signatures (sections).
Arbitrary page ranges can be transformed with rotation, cropping, x/y translation or scaling.

The app currently requires an external PDF viewer to view changes as they are made.

To install and run,
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/au/java/technologies/downloads/">download and install Java 19</a>
and then either download a runnable release jar and double
click on that, or check out the source and build the maven package target to produce a runnable jar.

All documentation is inline.
